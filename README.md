It is designed to simplify and standardize API development by offering a reliable and modular foundation for building scalable web services.

## ⚡ What is BrixJS?

BrixJS is a TypeScript-native framework for building modular and maintainable REST APIs using a **declarative YAML-based actor system**. It promotes conventions, strict typing, and reusable components to streamline backend development.

While the CLI tool is available in a [separate repository](https://github.com/airtrame/brixjs-cli), this package focuses on the **runtime engine** and fundamental logic that powers every BrixJS project.
